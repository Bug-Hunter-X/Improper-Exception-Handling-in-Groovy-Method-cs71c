# Groovy Exception Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Groovy: improper exception handling. The `myMethod` function fails to provide informative feedback when exceptions occur, returning `null` without explaining the reason for failure.  This can lead to debugging difficulties and unexpected behavior in applications.

The `bug.groovy` file contains the flawed code.  The `bugSolution.groovy` file provides a corrected version with robust exception handling, returning detailed error messages to aid in debugging.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.groovy` using a Groovy interpreter.
3. Observe the lack of specific error messages when exceptions are thrown.
4. Compare the output to that of `bugSolution.groovy` to see the difference in error handling.

## Solution

The solution involves:

* Specifying the types of exceptions to catch.
* Providing informative error messages describing the error and its cause.
* Returning more suitable values (e.g., throwing an exception, returning a more appropriate result) based on the type of error encountered.
